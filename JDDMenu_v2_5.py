Context-Aware Menu System Using JDDMenu and JDDMenuBuilder

This script provides the functionality to create dynamic, context-aware menus for console applications.
Using the JDDMenuBuilder and JDDMenu classes along with utility functions like dynamic_action_generator, 
users can build menus that adapt based on the provided context. The context is a dictionary containing 
information about the application's state, user details, or other relevant data.

Key Concepts:
- 'context': A dictionary passed to menu actions (callbacks), enabling them to behave differently based 
  on the current state or environment.
- 'JDDMenuBuilder': Used for building the menu with context-aware actions.
- 'JDDMenu': Displays the menu and handles user interaction, executing actions based on user input and context.
- 'JDDMenuUtils': Useful utility functions to help create menus

Usage of MenuUtils Features:

    1. Example usage of Dynamic Action Generator:
            
        dynamic_action = dynamic_action_generator(
        condition=lambda ctx: ctx.get('is_admin', False),
        action_if_true=admin_action,
        action_if_false=regular_user_action
        )
    
    2. Example usage of Safe Action Generator:

        def risky_action(ctx):
            # Code that may raise an exception
            ...

        # Wrapping the risky action in safe_action_generator
        safe_action = safe_action_generator(context, risky_action)
        safe_action()  # Executing the wrapped action safely



Create and Provide Context:
   user_context = {'is_admin': True}  # This would be dynamically determined by developers needs
   menu.display_menu(user_context)

This approach allows for creating menus that are not only interactive but also responsive to the current 
application state and user roles, enhancing user experience and system functionality.

class JDDMenu:
    """
    A class that represents a customizable menu system for console applications.

    The JDDMenu class provides a way to create interactive, text-based menus in the console.
    It allows for the addition of multiple menu options, each associated with a specific action
    (a function or a method). When a user selects an option, the corresponding action is executed.

    Attributes:
        menu_options (list of tuples): A list where each tuple contains a string (the menu option's
                                       text) and a callable (the action to be executed when the option
                                       is selected). The menu options are set during the initialization
                                       of the class and determine the behavior of the menu.

    Methods:
        display_menu(): Displays the menu options in the console and waits for the user's input.
                        Executes the action associated with the chosen option. The method handles
                        user input errors and allows for continuous operation until an exit condition
                        is met (like selecting an 'exit' option).

        continue_choice(): If enabled, prompts the user and asks if they would lke to continue using
                           the program. if they do not, it ends the program. This is disabled by default. 

    Usage example:
        # Creating menu options and actions
        def sample_action():
            print("Action executed.")

        # Creating a JDDMenu instance
        menu_items = [("Option 1", sample_action), ("Option 2", sample_action)]
        menu = JDDMenu(menu_items, title="My Custom Menu", exit_option_text="Leave", prompt="Please choose: ")

class JDDMenuBuilder:
    """
    A builder class for creating instances of the JDDMenu class.

    The JDDMenuBuilder facilitates the construction of a JDDMenu object by providing
    a fluent interface to add menu options and their associated actions. This approach
    allows for more readable and maintainable code when setting up complex menus.

    Important concepts to note when using:
        - Dynamic Actions: Allows creating actions that adapt based on the application's context using the `dynamic_action_generator`.
        - Parameterized Callbacks: Supports actions that accept additional parameters for enhanced flexibility.

    Attributes:
        menu_options (list of tuples): An internal list that stores the menu options 
                                       and their corresponding actions. Each tuple in
                                       this list contains a string (the text of the 
                                       menu option) and a callable (the action to be 
                                       executed when the option is selected).

    Methods:
        add_option(option_text, action):Adds a menu option to the internal list. Allows
                                        chaining for adding multiple options in a fluent manner.
        build(): Finalizes the construction of the JDDMenu object and returns it.

    Usage example:
        # Define actions for the menu
        def action1():
            print("Action 1 executed.")

        def action2():
            print("Action 2 executed.")

    safe_action_generator(context, action): Wraps a given action in error handling logic to manage and log
        exceptions that occur during action execution, enhancing the stability of the menu system.
